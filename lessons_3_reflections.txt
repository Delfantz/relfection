When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   i would use a remote ropository when i want to share my commit with other people that might are working on the same project.
   i can use also a remote repository as a cloud when i want to share with myself my project(maybe i have more than one pc),an
   example is this file.
   
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   maybe beacuse i don't want to have a sort of confusion in commits history or i don't want temporary other person's commit 
   
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
   clone a repository means copy all things in that repository and create another repository and paste that things. this happens the most of time when you want a gitHub repository on your own PC. i will use the clone command to download my repository that i have on my gitHub account on my PC.
   forks is like clone but all things happens on the gitHub servers. you can see how many times your repository has been forked and all the copies have a link to the origin one. i'll use the forks when i want to recognize other person's work and i want his file on my GitHub profile.
   a branch is not a command but a concept.you can use that to devide your project in different version. i'll use all the command on branches when i want to operate on them.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    because you can see the actually state of the project and for example see if other person had fixed a bug. if so,you don't have to fix that and you can work on something else.
