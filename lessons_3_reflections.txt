When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
   i would use a remote ropository when i want to share my commit with other people that might are working on the same project.
   i can use also a remote repository as a cloud when i want to share with myself my project(maybe i have more than one pc),an
   example is this file.
   
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
   maybe beacuse i don't want to have a sort of confusion in commits history or i don't want temporary other person's commit
